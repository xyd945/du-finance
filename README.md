## The Merrill Lynch Investment Clock

Our flagship tool implements the legendary **Merrill Lynch Investment Clock**, a framework that has guided institutional investors for decades in understanding economic cycles and asset allocation.

### 🕐 The Four Quadrants

The Investment Clock maps economic conditions across two key dimensions:

**📈 Growth Trend** (Y-axis): Economic expansion vs. contraction  
**📊 Inflation Trend** (X-axis): Rising vs. falling price pressures

This creates four distinct economic environments:

#### 🌱 **Recovery** (↗️ Growth ↗️, ↘️ Inflation ↘️)
- **Characteristics**: Economy accelerating, inflation falling
- **Traditional Assets**: Stocks outperform bonds  
- **Environment**: Central banks accommodative, corporate profits rising
- **Indicators**: Rising PMI, falling unemployment, stable prices

#### 🔥 **Overheat** (↗️ Growth ↗️, ↗️ Inflation ↗️)  
- **Characteristics**: Strong growth but rising inflation concerns
- **Traditional Assets**: Commodities shine, bonds underperform
- **Environment**: Central banks becoming hawkish, capacity constraints
- **Indicators**: High PMI, rising wages, increasing CPI

#### 🌊 **Stagflation** (↘️ Growth ↘️, ↗️ Inflation ↗️)
- **Characteristics**: Slowing growth with persistent inflation
- **Traditional Assets**: Cash and inflation-hedged assets preferred
- **Environment**: Policy dilemma, supply-side constraints
- **Indicators**: Falling PMI, high inflation, rising unemployment

#### ❄️ **Recession** (↘️ Growth ↘️, ↘️ Inflation ↘️)
- **Characteristics**: Economic contraction, deflationary pressures  
- **Traditional Assets**: Government bonds perform best
- **Environment**: Central banks cutting rates, fiscal stimulus
- **Indicators**: Low PMI, falling CPI, rising unemployment

### 📍 How Countries Are Positioned

Each country's position on the clock is determined by analyzing key economic indicators:

- **Composite PMI**: Overall economic momentum
- **Manufacturing PMI**: Industrial sector health  
- **CPI Year-over-Year**: Inflation rate
- **Core PCE/CPI**: Underlying inflation trends
- **GDPNow**: Real-time growth estimates

Our platform uses both **rule-based calculations** and **AI-powered analysis** to determine the most accurate positioning.

### 🎯 How to Use the Investment Clock

2. **Understand the Environment**: Each quadrant suggests different market dynamics
3. **Anticipate Transitions**: Watch for movement between quadrants
4. **Adjust Strategy**: Align your portfolio with the economic cycle
5. **Monitor Indicators**: Track the underlying data driving position changes
